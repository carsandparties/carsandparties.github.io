## Welcome to the Github Page of carsandparties.

Here I will share my journey to developing my STEM skills and also recent projects I'm working on. I intend for this blog to be useful to other people who are just starting on their own career path, or to whoever has already landed their dream job and can offer advice to a beginner. Some things I'm very interested in:

* Machine Learning
* Android Development
* Python
* Calculus
* Linear Algebra
* Convex Optimization
* C++
* Java
* Linux
* Quantum Electrodynamics
* Bayesian Inference
* and any/all other things tech-related.

This blog will be about any of the aforementioned topics, plus the occasional cat or two. :smile_cat:
Hope you stick around!
